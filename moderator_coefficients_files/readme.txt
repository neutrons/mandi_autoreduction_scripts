These files contain the Pade coefficients obtained from fitting MCSTAS simulations of moderator emissions for BL11.  The coefficients are for Pade approximants for alpha, beta, R, and T0 for the TOF profile over the range 1.e-5 eV to 100 eV.  For more details, see "SNS Source Descriptions for Use with MCSTAS.  SNS Technical Report SNS-106100200-TR01950-R00 by Franz Gallmeier.

franz_coefficients_2010.dat are parameters obtained by Franz's fits for BL11 in 2010.
franz_coefficients_2017.dat are parameters obtained by Franz's fits for BL11 in 2017, taking moderator poison burnup into account.
bl11_moderatorCoefficients_2018.dat are paramters obtained by Brendan's fit for BL11 after the IRP replacement (i.e. using IRP2).
fitModeratorCoefficients.ipynb is the notebook Brendan used to generate the coefficients and may be of use if they need to be generated again (i.e. for IRP3).
